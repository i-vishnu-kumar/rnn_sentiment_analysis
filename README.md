# rnn_sentiment_analysis
Tensorflow and keras implementation of rnn_sentiment analysis over imdb review dataset.

Implemented RNN first, due to more training time, changed to LSTM (which will also include long term memory for better response.
Further will update training will macos_os_metal for faster training in M2 Macs and, GRU can also be used for faster training for this purpose.

Furthermore; LSTM for next word predictions, I will upload next.
